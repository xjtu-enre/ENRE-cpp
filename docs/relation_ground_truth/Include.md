## Include
Descriptions: `Include Relation` means include other source file into current source file at the line immediately after the directive.

### Supported Patterns
```yaml
name: Include
```
#### Syntax: Include Declaration

```text
#include < h-char-sequence > new-line	(1)	
#include " q-char-sequence " new-line	(2)	
#include pp-tokens new-line	(3)	

__has_include ( " q-char-sequence " )
__has_include ( < h-char-sequence > )	(4)	(since C++17)

__has_include ( string-literal )
__has_include ( < h-pp-tokens > )	(5)	(since C++17)
```
